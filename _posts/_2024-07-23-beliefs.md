Here's a list of some of my beliefs:
- In an ideal world, there's no need for nonprofits; their need is filled by private companies
- We have the technology needed to disect what most mental illnesses really are at their root and to subsect them into diseases; we just need a massive amount of data to figure it out
- Orange is the best color
- The media portrays the state of San Francisco in an extremely negative, untrue light
- Not taking something/someone for granted doesn't mean you have to focus appreciate to it/them constantly
- Nobody will ever truly understand me and what's going on in my head, and I desperately hope someone shows up to prove me wrong
- The trade off of being a silly goose and making people smile, but consequently being perceived as dumb sometimes is totally worth it
- Addiction is an awful thing that can have amazing benefits
- Cold emails work like magic
- It's ok to talk the talk if you try your best to walk the walk; when you're starting out, it's actually super important to talk about your goals so that people know– it'll expand your surface of luck
- Doing the scary things never get less scary in the moment, but after a couple reps you start to gain the comfort that the consequences aren't that serious
- People say nobody's paying as much attention to you as you think; that's half true– people usually pay attention then disregard you as a nobody until you're a somebody
- A lot of people think they're worth more than they're paid; that's probably because they have the potentially to provide the value they think they're worth, but they're not doing it
- All people and all people's intentions are selfish in the end
- I want children, I don't know why (besides biologically)
