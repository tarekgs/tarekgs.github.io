Here's a list of some of my beliefs:
- In an ideal world, there's no need for nonprofits; their need is filled by private companies
- We have the technology needed to disect what most mental illnesses really are at their root and to subsect them into diseases; we just need a massive amount of data to figure it out
- Orange is the best color
- The media portrays the state of San Francisco in an extremely negative, untrue light
