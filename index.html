<!-- <p class="fade-in">Hey, I’m Tarek</p><br>
<p class="fade-in">I’m a DC-born, SF-located guy in my late twenties, living my own version of the California dream: sci-fi and startups, sunshine and surf.</p><br>
<p class="fade-in">Above all else, I value family. So it’s hard to live all the way across the country from them. But there’s a beautiful paradox in that I wouldn’t be here pursuing my dream and working to make an impact on the world without all of the love and encouragement they’ve given me.</p><br>
<p class="fade-in">I love reading sci-fi books <a href="https://heyimtarek.com/likes/2024/07/23/scifi.html">sci-fi books</a> and learning about the tech behind sci-fact startups <a href="https://heyimtarek.com/likes/2024/07/23/startups.html">sci-fact startups</a>, and I wrote a newsletter <a href="https://ohwowsocool.substack.com/">newsletter</a> for a bit that talked about the latter (on hiatus for now).</p><br>
<p class="fade-in">I’m currently focused on learning about neuromodulation, personal nutrition, how not to go all in (some things need a tapered entry, e.g. running), and how best to set up feedback loops for quick learning.</p><br>
<p class="fade-in">I’m the BizOps guy at Octant Bio <a href="https://www.octant.bio/">Octant Bio</a>, where I’m lucky to be able to have fun, learn something new, and move the needle pretty much every day. I take on projects across ops, finance, investor relations, HR, marketing/communications, IT, and more– the perfect training environment for me considering my ultimate goal of becoming a founder in the mental health space.</p><br>
<p class="fade-in">I’m an ENFP <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">ENFP</a> on the Myers-Briggs scale and an enneagram Type 7 <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7/">Type 7</a>. I’m an optimistic extrovert with a tendency to be slightly more silly at times than I probably should be. I’m scrappy; I’ll use sticks and stones if that's what’s needed to get the job done, but usually I’m also creative enough not to need to go that primitive. I like to push limits and dance along the line, mainly because it’s a great way to discover what’s possible but also because I think it’s an energizing way to live life.</p><br>
<p class="fade-in">A contrarian belief I strongly hold is that the common advice of “don’t tell people your plans, show them your results” actually handicaps anyone actually working towards a goal– if you don’t tell people where you’re going, they can’t help you get there. Not talking about the future also ruins the ability to answer one of my favorite no-small-talk ice breakers, which is “what are your hopes, dreams, and fears.”</p><br>
<p class="fade-in">So there you have it, a smidge of me that’s hopefully a good introduction to the whole of me. I’d love to meet you, please <a href="https://heyimtarek.com/contact">reach out</a> and say hey!</p><br> -->
